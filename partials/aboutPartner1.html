                    <p>Growing up in Cincinnati, Pam used to gather the natural clay from the creek bed and form objects d’art. At least
                       her mother thought so…. Fast forward to after college graduation and she decided to take a “clay” class from
                       Charlie Blosser at Oakland Community College and she caught the “bug” once again. And the rest is history, as they say.
                   </p>
                    <p>As a resident of Dexter for many “moons” she has taught clay classes to both children and adults
                      in the community and Ann Arbor. Pam has exhibited in galleries in Michigan and Ohio.
                      She can be found at Artistica, on Main Street in July for the annual Ann Arbor Art Fairs,
                       The Royal Oak Potters Market in December and other local art shows.
                     </p>
                     <p> Getting her hands into the “mud” is truly her bliss!</p>
